### 🔹 What is NumPy? 🤔
NumPy (Numerical Python) is a powerful Python library used for **numerical computing**. It provides support for **arrays, matrices, and mathematical functions** that operate efficiently on large datasets.

NumPy is widely used in:
- Data Science  
- Machine Learning  
- Scientific Computing  
- Engineering Applications  

---

### 🔹 Why Use NumPy? 🚀
Compared to normal Python lists, NumPy:
- Performs calculations faster  
- Uses less memory  
- Supports vectorized operations  
- Handles multi-dimensional arrays easily  

---

### 🔹 NumPy Arrays 📊
The main object in NumPy is the **array**.

#### ✨ Features of NumPy Arrays
- Stores elements of the same data type  
- Supports one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and multi-dimensional arrays  
- Enables fast mathematical operations  
- Allows indexing and slicing

### 🔹 Important Concepts in NumPy 🧠

#### 1️⃣ Array Creation
Arrays can be created from lists or by using built-in NumPy functions.

#### 2️⃣ Array Operations
NumPy supports:
- Addition  
- Subtraction  
- Multiplication  
- Division  
- Statistical operations (mean, sum, etc.)  

#### 3️⃣ Indexing and Slicing
Elements in an array can be accessed using index positions, and subsets of arrays can be extracted using slicing techniques.

#### 4️⃣ Reshaping Arrays
NumPy allows changing the shape of arrays without changing the data.
